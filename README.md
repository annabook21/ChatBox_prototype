‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRE-DEPLOYMENT STEP: ENABLE BEDROCK MODEL ACCESS**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you deploy this application, you **MUST** enable access to the required foundation models in your AWS account. **Failure to do so will cause the deployment to fail with an error.**

1.  Navigate to the **[Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home)** in your AWS account.
2.  In the bottom-left corner, click on **Model access**.
3.  Click **Manage model access** in the top-right.
4.  Enable access for the following two models:
    *   ‚úÖ **Titan Embeddings G1 - Text:** `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1` (Used for the Knowledge Base)
    *   ‚úÖ **Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet:** `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` (Used for generating answers)

Click "Save changes" and wait for access to be granted before proceeding with deployment.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend

- **CloudFront Distribution (`AWS::CloudFront::Distribution`):** Global CDN entry point serving the React app from two private S3 REST origins via OAC. Uses an origin group to fail over from the primary S3 origin (us-west-2) to the failover S3 origin (us-east-1) on 5xx.
- **Frontend S3 Buckets (`AWS::S3::Bucket`):** Private buckets (in each region) that store static assets. Access is restricted to CloudFront via Origin Access Control (OAC). No website endpoints or public access are used.

### 2. API Gateway

- **API Gateway (`AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi`):** Provides a RESTful API endpoint for the frontend to communicate with the backend. It includes throttling and usage plans for basic protection.
  - **`/docs` (POST):** The primary endpoint for submitting user queries to the chatbot.
  - **`/upload` (POST):** Generates pre-signed URLs for direct file uploads to S3.
  - **`/ingestion-status` (GET):** Returns the status of document ingestion jobs.
  - **`/health` (GET):** Health check endpoint that tests Bedrock KB connectivity. Can be used for monitoring or custom failover logic.

### 3. Backend Logic (5 Lambda Functions)

- **Query Lambda (`AWS::Lambda::Function`):** The core of the chatbot's logic. It's invoked by the API Gateway and is responsible for:
  - Receiving the user's query.
  - Calling the Bedrock `Retrieve` API to get relevant context from the knowledge base.
  - Calling the Bedrock `InvokeModel` API with Claude 3 Sonnet to generate an answer.
  - Applying Bedrock Guardrails for content safety (input and output filtering).
  - Returning the response, including citations, to the user.
  
- **Upload Lambda (`AWS::Lambda::Function`):** Generates pre-signed S3 URLs to allow the frontend to upload files directly to the Docs S3 Bucket without proxying through the backend.

- **Ingestion Lambda (`AWS::Lambda::Function`):** Triggered by S3 `PUT` events on the Docs S3 Bucket. This function starts an ingestion job in Bedrock, which processes the new document and adds it to the knowledge base.

- **Ingestion Status Lambda (`AWS::Lambda::Function`):** Polls Bedrock to check the status of ingestion jobs and reports back to the frontend.

- **Health Check Lambda (`AWS::Lambda::Function`):** Tests actual Bedrock Knowledge Base connectivity and returns system health status for monitoring.

### 4. Data Ingestion & Knowledge Base

- **Docs S3 Bucket (`AWS::S3::Bucket`):** The primary data source for the knowledge base. When a user uploads a file to this bucket, it triggers the ingestion process. It is configured with versioning for data protection and optional cross-region replication for DR.
- **Bedrock Knowledge Base (`Bedrock::VectorKnowledgeBase`):** The heart of the RAG pipeline. It automatically chunks documents into 500-token segments with 20% overlap, vectorizes them using Titan Embeddings, and stores them in a vector store for efficient retrieval.

### 5. Security & Content Safety

- **Bedrock Guardrails (`AWS::Bedrock::CfnGuardrail`):** Content filtering for harmful or inappropriate inputs and outputs. Configured with HIGH sensitivity for sexual content, violence, and hate speech, and MEDIUM for insults.
- **Model Access Check (`AWS::Lambda::Function`):** A pre-flight Lambda that validates Bedrock model access before deployment to prevent deployment failures.
- **API Usage Plan:** Throttling limits (100 req/sec rate, 200 burst) for basic API protection.

### 6. Monitoring & Observability

- **CloudWatch Dashboard (`AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard`):** Interactive dashboard named `contextual-chatbot-metrics` with 5 widget rows:
  - API Gateway performance (requests and errors)
  - Lambda function errors (Query and Ingestion)
  - Lambda duration metrics
  - Dead Letter Queue message count
  - Lambda invocation counts
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Three alarms for monitoring system health:
  - Query Lambda errors (>5 errors in 5 minutes)
  - Ingestion Lambda errors (>3 errors in 5 minutes)
  - Dead Letter Queue messages (any message appears)
- **SNS Topic (`AWS::SNS::Topic`):** Publishes alerts when alarms trigger.
- **Dead Letter Queue (`AWS::SQS::Queue`):** Captures failed ingestion events for manual review and retry.
- **X-Ray Tracing:** Enabled on all Lambda functions for distributed tracing and performance analysis.

### 7. Disaster Recovery & High Availability

- **Frontend Failover (CloudFront Origin Group):** Frontend remains on a single CloudFront URL. If the primary S3 origin (us-west-2) returns 5xx, CloudFront automatically retries against the failover S3 origin (us-east-1) and serves content without DNS changes. **RTO: < 1 second (automatic).**
- **Backend API Failover (Manual):** Both regions deploy full backend stacks with `/health` endpoints. To fail over the backend API, manually update `config.json` in both S3 frontend buckets to point to the failover API URL, then invalidate CloudFront cache. **RTO: Manual (minutes to hours depending on response time).**
- **Document Replication:** S3 Cross-Region Replication ensures documents uploaded to primary are automatically copied to failover. **RPO: 0-15 minutes.**

## Deployment

### Multi-Region Deployment with CDK üöÄ

**CDK automatically deploys to both us-west-2 (primary) and us-east-1 (failover)** for disaster recovery:

```bash
cd backend

# Bootstrap both regions (one-time setup)
ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
cdk bootstrap aws://$ACCOUNT/us-west-2
cdk bootstrap aws://$ACCOUNT/us-east-1

# Deploy to BOTH regions with a single command
cdk deploy --all
```

This deployment:
- ‚úÖ Creates `BackendStack-Primary` in us-west-2 with CloudFront distribution
- ‚úÖ Creates `BackendStack-Failover` in us-east-1
- ‚úÖ CloudFront automatically fails over frontend between S3 origins on 5xx
- ‚úÖ Backend API failover requires manual config.json update

**See [DISASTER_RECOVERY_SETUP.md](DISASTER_RECOVERY_SETUP.md) for complete DR details and optional Route 53 DNS failover setup.**

### Single-Region Deployment (Development)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed/configured first:

* **AWS CLI** installed and configured (`aws configure`) with valid access key/secret key.

  * Verify with: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
* **Node.js** ‚â• 22.9.0 and npm.
* **AWS CDK CLI**:

  ```bash
  npm install -g aws-cdk
  ```
* **Docker Desktop** installed and running (required for bundling Lambda assets).
* **Set your region** (supports `us-west-2` or `us-east-1`):

  ```bash
  export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2  # or us-east-1
  ```

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>/backend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install aws-cdk-lib constructs typescript ts-node --save-dev
   ```
3. **Bootstrap your AWS account**
   *(only needed once per account/region)*

   ```bash
   # For us-west-2
   cdk bootstrap aws://<your-account-id>/us-west-2
   
   # OR for us-east-1
   cdk bootstrap aws://<your-account-id>/us-east-1
   ```

   üîπ If you see `StagingBucket already exists` errors, delete the old bucket `cdk-hnb659fds-assets-<account>-<region>` in S3 and re-run bootstrap.
4. **Synthesize the stack**

   ```bash
   cdk synth
   ```

   This outputs the CloudFormation template so you can preview what will be deployed.
### 5. CRITICAL STEP 5: Enable Bedrock Model Access

For the chatbot to work, you MUST enable access to the specific foundation models in the Amazon Bedrock console.

1.  Navigate to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home) in your AWS account.
2.  In the bottom-left corner, click on **Model access**.
3.  Click **Manage model access** in the top-right.
4.  Enable access for the following models:
    *   **Titan Embeddings G1 - Text:** `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1` (for the Knowledge Base)
    *   **Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet:** `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` (for generating answers)

**FAILURE TO ENABLE THESE MODELS WILL CAUSE 500 ERRORS.**

## Usage

1.  After a successful `cdk deploy`, the CloudFormation outputs will display the `CloudFrontURL`.
2.  Navigate to this URL in your browser.
3.  The API URL is **auto-configured**. The UI will show "API URL (Auto-configured)".
4.  Use the "Upload Documents" section to upload one or more files (PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD) to the knowledge base.
5.  Wait for the ingestion status to show "‚úÖ Ingestion complete!". It may take an additional minute for the context to become available.
6.  Ask a question related to the documents you uploaded.

The chatbot will now answer based on the context provided in your documents.

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Issues

* **Error: `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`**
  ‚Üí Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running. Test with `docker ps`.

* **Error: `SSM parameter /cdk-bootstrap/... not found`**
  ‚Üí Run `cdk bootstrap aws://<account>/<region>` (replace with your region).

* **Error: `StagingBucket already exists` during bootstrap**
  ‚Üí Delete the old S3 bucket `cdk-hnb659fds-assets-<account>-<region>` or rerun bootstrap with `--bootstrap-bucket-name`.

* **Multi-region deployment**
  ‚Üí CDK automatically deploys to BOTH us-west-2 (primary) and us-east-1 (failover):

  ```bash
  cd backend
  cdk deploy --all
  ```
  
  This creates `BackendStack-Primary` (us-west-2) and `BackendStack-Failover` (us-east-1).
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Enable Bedrock model access in BOTH regions before deploying.

### Runtime Issues

* **Error: "You don't have access to the model"** or **"ValidationException: Invalid input or configuration"**
  ‚Üí Enable Bedrock model access (see step 5 above). The **Titan Embeddings** model is **required** for document ingestion!

* **Chatbot returns "Server side error"**
  ‚Üí Check CloudWatch logs: `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/query-bedrock-llm --follow --region <your-region>`
  ‚Üí Ensure you have uploaded documents and they have been processed (wait 1-2 minutes after upload)

* **File upload doesn't work**
  ‚Üí Check browser console for errors
  ‚Üí Verify the upload Lambda exists: `aws lambda get-function --function-name generate-upload-url --region <your-region>`

* **Documents not appearing in knowledge base**
  ‚Üí Check ingestion logs: `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/start-ingestion-trigger --follow --region <your-region>`
  ‚Üí Verify Titan Embeddings model access is enabled
